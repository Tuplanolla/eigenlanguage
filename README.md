# Eigenlanguage

Eigenlanguage is a programming language prototype.
It is a purely functional, dynamically typed and lazily evaluated one.
Its features are a mix of the most distinct features of Haskell, Scheme and J.
The goal is to make it as minimal as possible and focus on pedagogical aspects.
Symmetries similar to those in physics will also be emphasized heavily.
It is by no means a serious project, but might one day turn out to be.

A detailed explanation in the form of unintelligible rambling is available on
[the author's personal website](http://users.jyu.fi/~sapekiis/eigenlanguage/).
